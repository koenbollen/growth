growth.py - Self-sustaining Python Network

growth.py is the application that exists as one node in one large network
of little Python agents.

growth.py is the service and toolkit for creating a self-sustaining network
of Python nodes without a central server or a command&control-channel. This
is an IPv6-only project due to problems surrounding NAT, routing and firewalls,
also this was started as a demo for the IPv6Day in Holland.

With such a network, full of growth.py nodes, you able to create a python job
or python file, sign it with your private key (and let friends sign it with
theirs) and send it into the network. Every node will receive this python file,
but only the those who can verify it with a stored public certificate will
execute them. Now, this is were things gets interesting; You can create
distributed computing tasks, or launch a large DDOS attack. It's even possible
to create a self-updater job (code included). Every thing that the programming
language Python can do is now done distributed.
